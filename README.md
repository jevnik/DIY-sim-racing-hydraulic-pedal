# DIY SIM RACING HYDRAULIC BRAKE PEDAL

## Description

This is an open source hydraulic brake pedal that can be used on PC and any game. Max braking pressure can be set as much one likes by picking a coresponding pressure transducer. With an 1000psi transducer it measures much more than I can press or that my sim rig can take without flex. Pedal can be assembled completly with only using common and cheap tools that most DIY people will have. No welding required even tho if you have a welder you can make yourself life easier and build the pedal faster. 

## Tools needed
* Angle grider
* Hand drill
* Set of wrenches
  
## Usage

Within a project you will find solidworks, step and stl folder that hold respective format of 3d models. Once you open the files, assembly is straight forward but feel free to contact me or ask anything that seems unclear. This will get updated in future by me or by other contributors.

## Contributing

Feel free to make changes, suggestions, forks and contributions. I would like to see this project grow and become more refined. Also please share pictures or stories if you decide to build it. Would love to see those. 


## Documentation

For more detailed explanation of the build, assembly and stuff needed open a documentation folder. There will be a list of parts needed, explaining of assembly and production.

## License

You are free to use the software, examine, modify it, and distribute the modifications only thing I ask is to mention me as a original creator in any media created.
